	# Shell passes us command line split into words in the
	# COMP_WORDS array, but its idea about word separator
	# characters doesn't match our goals. In particular, it
	# considers '=' character the word separator, which breaks
	# the long options and considers ':' character the word
	# separator, which breaks the host:port parameters and
	# HTTP URLs.
	#
	# _get_comp_words_by_ref from the bash-completion package re-splits
	# the command line allowing some characters to be excluded
	# from the word separators list with the -n option. Nut now
	# we have another problem: shell automatically removes current
	# word prefix from the COMPREPLY strings, but after re-split the
	# current word might have been extended with the additional
	# prefix which shell doesn't know about and hence cannot
	# remove, so we have to help it.
